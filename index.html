    <h1>Creating Your First Website!</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>First you will need to make an account on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> </li>
        <li>Once you have created your account, you will need to set up a repository.
            <ul>
                <ul><i>TIP Using a real name instead of an odd psuedonom can look more professional!</i> </ul>
            </ul>
            </li>
        <li>Now that you have your GitHub ready to rock and roll, you need to download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>  </li>
        <li>Once downloaded and installed you will then create a folder with both an index.html file and an image of yourself. </li>
        <li>Now head into Visual Studio and insert the following code: <br>
            <pre><code>
            html
                h1 Username's Portfolio /h1
                img src="./Image.JPEG" />
            /html
        </code>
            </pre></li>
        <li>Finally, go back into GitHub and upload both the index.html file and image file into your repository. BAM!</li>
